  Eight player game of VivaJava for this game session.  This game is an interesting brew of mechanics and simultaneous play with changing alliances from round to round.  Your score is partly determined by how well you work within those changing teams and then in how much you choose to research.

  The only glaring mistake that I think I made last night was that the beans from the bonus Grow research track were optional.  I hope that you all enjoyed the game, if we keep getting large attendance this game might see some more play.

  My biggest problem with this VivaJava is the color scheme.  The biggest positive for me here is the simultaneous play aspect  It felt like people actually might have gotten more "play" time then usual in a large group because you were not waiting for your turn to come back around.  Any thoughts from anyone else?

  As always, let me know if you dislike a specific game or genre of games, Garrett and I will do our best to keep those off the table on game nights when you attend.
