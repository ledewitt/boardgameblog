Eight knights braved the cold and snowy evening to attend game night at Garrett's.

 We then started traveling the world for the best coffee beans we could find and attempting to roast them into the greatest tasting blends in [Viva Java](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/103660/vivajava-coffee-game).

I decided for this play I wanted to invest early to grab ahold of some easy points by riding on another teams blend for a few rounds.  Turns out I just ended up with 1 point for one round on my gamble for an early investment.  Tom's investments made him a bunch of points mid game but did hamper him through at the end game as he found himself late in turn order.  Steve and Adam pushed a roasting strategy and from what I remember did not invest, instead choosing to work on making great blends.  Eric, Garrett, and Tim were in it but couldn't seem to catch onto a great roast or make their investments work out.
