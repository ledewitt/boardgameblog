Hello Everyone!

It was a great year for "Garrett's Glorious & Groovy Game Nights" - G4N

16 Game Nights - 9 at Luke's, 2 at Eric's, 6 at Garrett's.

We played at least:
Mission Red Planet
Dark Moon
Thunder Alley
Dominant Species
Black Friday
Medici
Formula De
Fools Gold
El Grande
Lords of Vegas
Cyclades
Roll for the Galaxy
Dark Moon
Medici
Citadels

I recommend all these games even if its a little late for Christmas shopping!

Due to terrible record keeping by me this is mostly wrong, but what I have is this and its now official  :)

Wins (Not counting dark moon and other team games) :
First Place - 5 way tie with two wins:
Scott
Garrett
Eric
Luke
Colten

Second Place - 2 way tie with one win:
Steve
Frank

Most Played Game:
Medici twice, Dark Moon twice.

Garrett's Favorite Game this year:
Dark Moon.
While I enjoyed both Dark Moon nights, the first Dark Moon night, the one with the epic lucky roll to win at the last possible opportunity for the non-infected team, was really awesome and probably my favorite moment of the year.

Max Attendance 7, Min Attendance 3. (Luke might correct me if there was a 2 person night at his house this year, but I think 3 was the smallest group)

Thanks to everyone
(Bret
Colten
Eric
Scott

Frank)
who attended in 2018 and thus allowed me and Luke to get more games to the table!

I hope to see you all next year in late January or February.
