  For the last game night of the year we pulled out two classics.  One is a favorite of the Knights and might have been our most played game this year, Garrett's final count of the year will tell the tale.  Medici is the auction set collection game of choice at 6 players in my opinion and this was a very interesting play through.  If you told me you could win this game without winning a single auction of the gold card I would have had a hard time believing it.  However, neither the first place player or the second place player won the gold card in any of the three rounds.  Was a great and tight game actually one of the best for bidding strategy I think I have seen.  I have the picture of the final board but I could not remember the 5th and 6th place player to color association so I took a guess.  Eric or Steve let me know if this is right if you remember?  Congratulations are also in order as Scott gets his first win at game night well done.

  We decided to squeeze in on more game for the last game night of the year and it went a little longer than advertised, sorry.  It has been a long time since I have played Citadels and in my memory I do not remember it being any longer than an hour on average.  Playing it reminded me how much I like the straight up brutal nature of this game.  The swings are wild and I would not want to play it all the time but it is an enjoyable change of pace that I can see getting more play time and improving time length as the number of Knights in the group get a good handle on the mechanics of how it is played.  This is Steve's second win, he also won Chicago Express a game night recap I haven't sent yet.
